These Python workbooks were created to process and find seismic anomalies using our RS seismographs. Here you will find the following:

1.- RSAnomalyDetectFunctionsv2.py : Contains the definitions of each core function that make up the first draft of our detection algorithm.

2.- TestmyRSFunctions.py : Contains unit tests with 'unittest' that ensure the correct operation of the core functions that make up the first draft of our detection algorithm.

3.- VisualTestmyRSFunctions.py: Contains visual examples of how to use the functions in RSAnomalyDetectFunctionsv2.py.
